# Skill Recommendation System - Complete Dependencies
# ======================================================
#
# This file lists ALL dependencies required for the Skill Recommendation System,
# including external packages and Python standard library modules.
#
# Python Version: 3.8+ (tested with Python 3.12.2)
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: Standard library modules are listed for complete documentation.
# They are included with Python and do not require installation.
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a pip requirements file. For conda environments, use:
#   conda env create -f environment.yml
# Conda should NOT be listed here - it's a package manager, not a Python package.

# ======================================================
# External Dependencies (require pip install)
# ======================================================

# Numerical computing and linear algebra
numpy>=1.21.0          # Array operations, matrix computations
scipy>=1.7.0            # Sparse matrices (csr_matrix), linear algebra (solve)
pandas>=2.0.0          # Data manipulation and analysis


# ======================================================
# Notebook Requirements (for Jupyter notebook execution)
# ======================================================
# Required to run complete_pipeline.ipynb notebook

jupyter>=1.0.0        # Jupyter notebook environment
ipykernel>=6.0.0      # IPython kernel for Jupyter
notebook>=6.0.0       # Jupyter notebook web application

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.5.0     # Plotting and visualization

# ======================================================
# GPU Support (Optional - for GPU-accelerated training)
# ======================================================
# Uncomment the following if you want GPU acceleration:
# Note: Current implementation uses CPU-only (numpy/scipy).
# For GPU support, you would need to modify the code to use:
# - cupy>=12.0.0          # GPU-accelerated NumPy (CUDA)
# - jax[cuda12]>=0.4.0    # JAX with CUDA support (alternative)
# 
# WARNING: GPU support requires CUDA toolkit and compatible GPU.
# The current WALS implementation is CPU-only by default.
# See docs/GPU_SUPPORT.md for details on adding GPU support.

# ======================================================
# Python Standard Library Dependencies
# ======================================================
# The following modules are part of Python's standard library.
# They are listed here for complete documentation of system dependencies.
# Python version required: 3.8+ (recommended: 3.9+)

# Core system modules
# sys                    # System-specific parameters and functions
# os                     # Operating system interface

# Data serialization and persistence
# pickle                 # Object serialization (model saving/loading)
# sqlite3                # SQLite database interface

# File I/O and archives
# csv                    # CSV file reading and writing
# zipfile                # ZIP archive handling
# pathlib                # Object-oriented filesystem paths

# Date and time
# datetime               # Date and time objects
# time                   # Time-related functions

# Numeric operations
# decimal                # Decimal floating point arithmetic

# Utilities
# logging                # Logging facility
# argparse               # Command-line argument parsing
# tempfile               # Temporary file and directory creation
# typing                 # Type hints support
